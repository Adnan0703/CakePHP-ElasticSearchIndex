# Elastic Search Index

This is a layer on top of the
[Elasitc](https://github.com/dkullmann/CakePHP-Elastic-Search-DataSource)
which simplifies things a lot - thanks to
[Searchable/SearchIndex](https://github.com/zeroasterisk/Searchable-Behaviour-for-CakePHP)
and our customizations.

With this, you keep your models on your own normal (default) datasource.  All
saves and finds and joins and callbacks... normal.

But when you attach this behavior, you now have additional callbacks which
gather the data you want to use as a search index... it stores that data to
ElasticSearch via it's own datasource, `index` as setup via the (above) Elastic
plugin.

What you end up with is having you cake and eating it too.

* Your Model and datasource are unchanged and work as before.
* The searchy goodness of ElasticSearch is avaialble to you against this
  indexed, second copy.

## Install

```
git submodule add https://github.com/zeroasterisk/CakePHP-ElasticSearchIndex app/Plugin/ElasticSearchIndex
# or
git clone https://github.com/zeroasterisk/CakePHP-ElasticSearchIndex app/Plugin/ElasticSearchIndex

```

In `app/Config/bootstrap.php` load the plugin
```
CakePlugin::load('Elastic');
CakePlugin::load('ElasticSearchIndex');
```

In your `Model`
```
	public $actsAs = array(
		'ElasticSearchIndex.ElasticSearchIndexable' => array(),
	);
```

In your `Model` you can also set `fields` to limit what gets indexed
```
	public $actsAs = array(
		'ElasticSearchIndex.ElasticSearchIndexable' => array(
			'fields' => array('title', 'name', 'email', 'city', 'state',  'country'),
		),
	);
```

## How to Save Records

It's automatic, after every save, it will post that record to the database.

* **TODO: ensure we are only saving one record per Model+Id, not multiple**
* **TODO: delete the ElasticSearchIndex record upon delete**

## How to Search

There's a really useful method on the behavior, which returns only the primary
keys for search results.  This can easily be added to any `conditions` array.

```
$conditions = array(
	"{$this->alias}.{$this->primaryKey}" => $this->searchAndReturnAssociationKeys('Search Term'),
);
```

If you are using the [CakeDC/search](https://github.com/CakeDC/search) plugin,
you can use this to make subquery or query filters... *(which is sweet!)*

* **TODO: make a simple find/search helper on the behaivor**

## Attribution

This project is really a simple re-work of Searchable/SearchIndex to work in
concert with the Elastic DataSource...  The guts of the work is theirs.  Big thanks!
